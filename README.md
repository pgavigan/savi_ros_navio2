# savi_ros_navio2
Connection scripts for SAVI and the Navio2 components to work together.

---- USE https://github.com/NMAI-lab/savi_ros_navio2/tree/development instead of this REPO. ----

Based on these tutorials:
https://github.com/emlid/mavros-navio-python-example
https://docs.emlid.com/navio2/common/dev/ros/

Setup prodeedure: Git pull this into a catkin workspace and call catkin_make. You should be good to go from there.

1) Run ardupilot and mavros as per instructions in links above. Extracted from those links is the following:

Start ROS
```
Run roscore
```

Start arducoper
```
sudo systemctl start arducopter
sudo systemctl enable arducopter
```

Start MavROS
```
rosrun mavros mavros_node \
_fcu_url:=udp://:14650@ \
_gcs_url:=udp://:14551@192.168.1.189:14550
```

Setup MavROS to work without a ground station. This sets a steam rate (I don't know what that means).
```
rosservice call /mavros/set_stream_rate 0 10 1
```

2) Run the new node
```
rosrun savi_ros_navio2 navioPerceptions.py
```
